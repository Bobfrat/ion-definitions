This directory contains the predefined stream types for each class of dataset.

At the moment these are inaccessible and are not created as ionobjects. I can't seem to get that to work?

These datastructure for a CTD is implemented in code via a utility method to construct it at the moment in:
ion/services/dm/example/ctd_stream.py

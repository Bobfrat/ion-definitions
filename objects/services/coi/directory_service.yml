      Returns the UI specifications as a composite data structure (dict).
      The dict has several keys:
      Key 'objects' contains a dict mapping object ids to objects.
      Key 'associated_to' contains a dict mapping subject ids to lists of predicate and object id.
      Key 'associated_from' contains a dict mapping object ids to lists of predicate and subject id.

    docstring: |
      Create a timer which will send TimerEvents as requested for a given schedule.
      The schedule request is expressed through a specific subtype of TimerSchedulerEntry.
      The event is delivered as a TimeEvent to which processes can subscribe. The creator
      defines the fields of the event. A GUID-based id prefixed by readable process name
      is recommended for the origin. Because the delivery of the event is via the ION Exchange
      there is potential for a small deviation in precision.
      Returns a timer_id which can be used to cancel the timer.

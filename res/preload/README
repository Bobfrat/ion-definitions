This directory and subdirectories contain dumped CouchDB data that will get preloaded
back into the datastores for quick initialization and sample data. Preload happens
automatically under certain start conditions, e.g. ION start with r2deploy.yml

The convention is to load from a subdirectory with a logical datastore name, e.g.
"resources", "objects" etc.

The contents of the local subdirectory are not under version control and can be used
to dump data and to keep data for local testing.
